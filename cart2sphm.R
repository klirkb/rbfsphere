cart2sphm <- function(x){
#CART2SPHM Transform Cartesian to spherical coordinates.
#   [TH,PHI,R] = cart2sph(X) transforms corresponding elements of
#   data stored in Cartesian coordinates to spherical
#   coordinates (azimuth TH, elevation PHI, and radius R). The matrix X is
#   assumed to contain N rows and 3 columns where each row contains the
#   (x,y,z) Cartesian coordinate of the point.
#
#   Same as matlab function cart2sph, but this accepts a single matrix with
#   the data.
