getMaxDetNodes <- function(N){
#GETMAXDETNODES Returns the set of N maximal determinant nodes of Womersley and
#   Sloan.
#
#   X = getMaxDetNodes(N) returns an N-by-3 matrix containing the maximal
#   determinant nodes on the sphere computed by Womersley and Sloan. These
#   are nodes arranged on the sphere so that the determinant of a certain
#   Gram matrix related to spherical harmonics is maximized, which requires
#   solving a non-linear optimization problem. The columns of X corresponds
#   to the (x,y,z) cordinates of the nodes.
#
#   These nodes have been computed for several values of N and put on the
#   web by Prof. Womersley at:
#        http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~rsw/Sphere/Extremal/New/index.html
#   This code simply provides a way to access these nodes from MATLAB.
#
#   IMPORTANT NOTE: Presently only nodes N that are a perfect square
#   between 4 and 27556 are available, with the additional set of N=36864.
#   An error is returned if the node set is not available.
#
#   [x,wghts] = getMaxDetNodes(N) Also returns a set of quadrature weights
#   for the nodes.  These weights are provided in the node sets that are
#   downloadable from the web.
#
#   For more information on how the nodes are computed see:
#   I. H. Sloan and R. S. Womersley, Extremal systems of points and
#   numerical integration on the sphere, Advances in Computational
#   Mathematics 21 (2004) 107--125.
#
#   Example 1:
#       x = getMaxDetNodes(64^2);  # Retuns 4096 nodes on the sphere.
#       plotSphNodes(x);
#
#   Example 2:
#       [x,wghts] = getMaxDetNodes(64^2);  # Retuns 4096 nodes and weights.
#       area_sphere = wghts'*ones(64^2,1);
