#CARTV2SPHV Converts vectors tangent to the sphere from Cartesian to
#spherical coordinates.
#
#   [LAM,TH,US,VS] = cartv2sphv(X,Y,Z,UC,VC,WC) converts a vector field
#   tangent to the sphere that is expressed with respect to Cartesian
#   coordinates to a one that is expressed with respect to spherical
#   coordinates. X, Y, Z are the locations where the field is sampled, with
#   UC, VC, and WC being the values of the field in the (X,Y,Z) directions.
#   LAM and TH are the respective azimuthal and elevation (longitude and
#   latitude) values of X, Y, and Z, where -pi < LAM <= PI and
#   -pi/2 <= TH <= pi/2.  US and VS are the values of the field in the LAM
#   and TH directions, respectively.
#
#   Example:
#       [x,y,z] = sphere(20);
#       u = -y;
#       v = x;
#       w = 0*x;
#       [lam,th,us,vs] = cartv2sphv(x,y,z,u,v,w);
#       quiver(lam,th,us,vs)
